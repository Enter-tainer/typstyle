= Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of advanced formatting techniques in Typst, demonstrating various features including mathematical notation, citations, and complex layouts.

= Introduction

Modern document preparation systems must balance ease of use with powerful formatting capabilities @knuth1984tex. Typst addresses these requirements through its innovative approach to markup and layout.

== Research Questions

1. How does Typst compare to traditional LaTeX systems?
2. What are the performance characteristics of the formatting engine?
3. Can Typst handle complex academic documents effectively?

= Methodology

Our analysis involved three main components:

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    [Method], [Sample Size], [Duration],
    [Benchmark A], [100], [5 min],
    [Benchmark B], [500], [12 min],
    [Benchmark C], [1000], [25 min],
  ),
  caption: [Performance benchmark results across different document sizes.]
)

The mathematical foundation can be expressed as:

$ sum_(i=1)^n x_i = integral_0^infinity f(x) dif x $

= Results

#figure(
  rect(width: 100%, height: 100pt, fill: gray.lighten(80%)),
  caption: [Placeholder for performance visualization chart.]
)

Performance improved significantly with larger document sizes, suggesting efficient memory management and processing optimization.

= Conclusion

Typst demonstrates remarkable capabilities for academic document preparation, offering both simplicity and advanced features required for scholarly work.
