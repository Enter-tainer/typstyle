= Comment Formatting Problems

==Inline Comments Mess

Typstyle fixes poorly positioned inline comments:

#let config(
  title: "My Document", //bad spacing
  authors: ("Alice", "Bob"), /*bad comment
                             positioning and indentation*/
  lang: "en", //no space
  date: datetime.today(), //missing space
) = {
  // misaligned function body
}

== Block Comments

Multi-line block comments are automatically aligned:

#{
  let x = 1 /* This is a block comment
            that spans multiple lines
            and gets properly aligned */

  /* Another block comment
  with different indentation
  that Typstyle will format */
  let y = 2
}

== Comment Alignment

Comments with leading stars are preserved:

/* Block comment with leading stars
 * that maintains consistent
 * formatting across lines
 * for better readability
 */

== Escape Hatch

Use `// @typstyle off` to preserve specific formatting:

// @typstyle off
#let preserve_this_spacing    =    "exactly as written"
#let normal_formatting = "this gets cleaned up"

== Complex Comment Patterns

#{
  let calculate(..args) = {}

  // Nested comments in code blocks
  if true {
    let result = calculate(
      // Inline calculation
      value: 42, /* The answer to everything
                 according to Douglas Adams */
      precision: 3, // Decimal places
    )
  }

  /* Multi-line comment explaining
     the algorithm complexity:
     - Time: O(n log n)
     - Space: O(n)
  */
}

== Comments in Function Calls

#figure(
  caption: [Data visualization], // Figure caption
  placement: top, /* Position at top of page
                  for better flow */
  table(
    columns: 3,
    // Three-column layout
    [A], [B], [C],
    // Headers
    [1], [2], [3],
    // Data row
  ),
)
