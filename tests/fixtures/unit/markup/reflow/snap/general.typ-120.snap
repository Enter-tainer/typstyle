Here is some normal text followed by an equation: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ and more text.

This line contains *strong text* mixed with `raw code` and regular words.

Let's add a complex equation:
$ integral_0^infinity e^(-x^2) dif x = sqrt(pi)/2 $
surrounded by text.

Testing _multiple_ `inline` $"elements"$ in a single line with various _spacing_ patterns.

Some text with equations $E = m c^2$ and $F = m a$ inline with _emphasized words_ and `code snippets`.

Here's a paragraph with line breaks and multiple spaces to test reflow behavior with $"complex" = (a + b)^2$ equations.

Technical terms like ```ts Array<T>``` mixed with *important notes* and $sum_(i=1)^n x_i$.

// Testing comments and special characters Let's include #hashtags and @mentions with $theta$ and `const`.

- Simple list item with *bold text* and $alpha$ equation
- Multi-line list item with `code` and continuation with extra spaces
- List with equation: $f(x) = sin(x)$ and _emphasis_

/ Term: Definition with *strong* and $beta$ mixed
/ Complex Term:
  Multi-line definition with `code block` and $integral$ equation
/ Technical: Uses ```ts Array<T>``` with *important* notes about $theta$

+ First enumerated item with `inline code` and $x^2$ equation
+ Second item with *bold* and multiple spaces
+ Mixed content: _emphasis_, $pi$, and `const`

- Nested items Just nested items:
  - Sub-item with $alpha$ and *bold*
  - Another with `code` and line breaks
  - Mixed _formatting_ and $beta$ here

- List item with #strong[bold text inside function] and regular text
- Item with nested functions #emph[emphasized with #strike[strikethrough]] and continuation

/ Term with functions: Using #text(blue)[colored text] with $alpha$ formula
/ Complex function:
  #table(
    columns: (auto, auto),
    [*Header 1*], [*Header 2*],
    [Content], [More #emph[styled] content],
  )
  Text after function call.

+ Enumerated with #link("https://example.com")[link text] and `code`
+ Item using #text(size: 1.2em)[larger text] with spacing
+ Mixed #strong[formatted] and #emph[emphasized] content with $E = m c^2$

- #block[
    Multi-line block content with nested #strong[formatting] and extra spaces
  ]

/ Functions with parameters: Definition using #text(weight: "bold", size: 12pt)[Formatted text with spaces] and
  $"equations"$

= Heading with *mixed* `formatting` and $"math"$ elements
Text between headings.
== Sub-heading with #text(blue)[colored] and #text(style: "italic")[styled] text

=== Another heading
Multi-paragraph list item:
- This is a list item with multiple paragraphs.

  Second paragraph in the same list item with irregular spacing.

  Third paragraph with *strong*, _emphasized_, and `code` elements.

- List item with a footnote#footnote[This is a footnote with *formatting* and $"equations"$ that should correctly
    reflow] and continuation.

/ Term with long content:
  This is a very long description that will likely need to wrap when formatted properly. It contains *strong text*,
  `inline code`, and $"math" = "elements"$ with various spacing patterns to test how reflow handles complex term
  definitions that extend beyond the normal line length.

#figure(
  ```python
  def example():
      # This is a code block with syntax highlighting
      return "test" + " " + "string"
  ```,
  caption: [Figure with *formatted* caption and $"math"$ elements],
)

Multi-paragraph markup with complex elements:
- List item with #text(fill: rgb(10%, 20%, 30%))[
    Multi-line content inside a function with nested #strong[formatting] and equations $sum_(i=1)^n x_i^2$
  ]

- Item with #grid(
    columns: (1fr, 1fr),
    [Cell with *formatting*], [Another cell with $"math"$ and `code`],
  )

/ Term with display math:
  $ sum_(i=0)^n i = frac(n(n+1), 2) $
  And explanation with more text following
Text with special Unicode: "Em—dash" and "en–dash" with *formatting* mixed in áéíóú äëïöü characters.

This paragraph contains special sequences that shouldn't be interpreted as markup: A mathematical expression like 3 +
4 = 7 should remain intact. Symbol sequences like a / b or x - y should not be treated as list markers.

This might be yet a bit cleaner.
#highlight[Actually, it's muuuuuch worse in performance. Moreover the first version can be optimized to compute many
  marks at once.
