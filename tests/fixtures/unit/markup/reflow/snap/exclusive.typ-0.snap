Some
pieces
should
be
exclusion
except
$"inline equation"$
and
`raw`:
- This
  is
  a
  list
$
  "block equation"
$
#figure([Figures])
#figure([Labeled
  figures])
<label>
That's
all!
Wait,
a
linebreak
\
should
be
\
kept
at
the
end
\
of
the
line.
\
But
\ /
never
\ =
break
\ +
before
\ -
markers
#[Never
  \ /
  Give
  \ =
  You
  \ +
  Up
  \
]

#let fig = (
  ..,
) => []
#fig(
  "image1",
)[Caption]
<label1>
#fig(
  "image2",
)[Caption]
<label2>

This
is
a
code
block:
#{
  // code block!
}
I
don't
want
to
eat
the
linebreak.
A
blocky
node
should
not
stick
#[

]
the
content
after
it.
Not
#if true { }
Not
#while false { }
Not
#for i in range(
  5,
) { }
Not
#context 1
And
block
equations:
$
  eq
$
And
also
``` block
raw ```
but
not
``` non-block raw ```
End
...
