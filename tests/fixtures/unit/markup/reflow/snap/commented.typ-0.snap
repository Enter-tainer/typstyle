/// typstyle: wrap_text

This
is
a
paragraph
with
// an inline comment that shouldn't break
the
flow
of
text
or
create
a
new
line.
The
formatter
should
handle
// multiple comments spread across
several
lines
while
maintaining
proper
*formatting*
and
`code elements`.

Here's
text
with
/* block-style comments */
mixed
with
*strong
text*
and
$"math" "equations"$
to
ensure
/* multi-line
block comments */
don't
interfere
with
text
flow
or
// inline elements.

Testing
comments
near
special
characters:
a +
b
// comment after plus
x -
y
/* comment after minus */
term /
definition
// comment after slash
heading =
title
// comment after equals

A
complex
case
mixing
everything:
*bold
text*
// comment after strong
`code block`
/* block comment */
with
$"math"$
// final comment
and
#text(
  red,
)[colored
  text]
// with formatting
